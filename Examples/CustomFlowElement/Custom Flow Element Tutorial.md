This series of examples illustrates how to create a simple flow element and then build on this to:
- Use a data file as a lookup (with automatic update functionality).
- Add evidence gathered from client-side JavaScript. Open the FiftyOne.Pipeline.Web solution to see an end-to-end demo project that makes use of this concept.
- Add a cloud-based version of your element. To view this example, open the FiftyOne.CloudRequestEngine solution.
