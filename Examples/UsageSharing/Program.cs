/// Usage sharing is enabled by default if using a pipeline builder 
/// that is derived from FiftyOnePipelineBuilder.
/// For instance, the DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder.
/// In this example, we show how to add a ShareUsageElement to a 
/// Pipeline using configuration.
/// 
/// As with all ElementBuilders, this can also be handled in code, 
/// using the ShareUsageBuilder. The commented section in the example 
/// demonstrates this.
/// 
/// The appsettings.json file contains all the configuration options.
/// These are all optional, so each can be omitted if the default 
/// for that option is sufficient:
/// 
/// @include UsageSharing/appsettings.json
/// 
/// For further details of what each setting does, see the 
/// [share usage builder reference](https://51degrees.com/pipeline-dotnet/class_fifty_one_1_1_pipeline_1_1_engines_1_1_fifty_one_1_1_flow_elements_1_1_share_usage_builder_base.html) 
///
/// This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/pipeline-dotnet/blob/master/Examples/UsageSharing/Program.cs).

/// Expected output
/// ```
/// Constructing pipeline from configuration file.
/// 
/// Pipeline created with share usage element, evidence processed 
/// with this pipeline will now be shared with 51Degrees using the
